Chocolatier is simply a PowerShell code generator and it was conceived in order to facilitate the selection and installation of your favorite applications in one go.

Chocolatier uses Chocolatey Software Management Tool to install all selected applications, and therefor Chocolatey will be installed too.

This is a Open Source project and we are not responsible in case of application failure or similar issues. All informations about Chocolatey can be found here [community.chocolatey.org](https://community.chocolatey.org "community.chocolatey.org")
